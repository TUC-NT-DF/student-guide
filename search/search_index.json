This is not right because there can always be subtle differences and it is always a good idea to double check on your own side before asking others. Second, it is important to recollect and retrace your steps while doing something second (or third usw) time because it is possible that you left out some small but critical step along the way. When we do something repeatedly, we slowly (and quite naturally) gain more and more confidence that we are doing things right and we are less and less skeptical of our performance. But this is kind of a fallacy.

It may affect the way you conduct the test drive, the locations you choose to go, various settings, configurations.</li> <li>Once you have enlisted the solid reason(s), motivation(s) for the test drive, think what data you would generate and in what format. Have a clear picture of what data you want to record and how you will do it. Do you need extra tools? Is your recording fully automatic or requires manual intervention? Do you have any concerns about your tools not working? Do you need to test them first before you start the actual test drive? Think about any likely but easily unforeseen situations. For example, if you are using some sort of map service and it is possible that you might not have Internet during the test drive, then you would probably want to cache the map before you start! Also, many times the data that you generate during your test drive is going to be volume intensive. So try to record data (for example your log files) in a way that it is easy to programatically read and parse it.</li> <li>Do you have any special requirements in the test drive? Should the car go through tunnels? Does the car need to be on a busy street or a highway? If there are such special requirements, make sure you talk about it with the person driving the car beforehand. Ideally, you should have a route prepared already.</li> <li>Might be beneficial to create small tables or text files in which you type in various kinds of details during the test drive. You should keep a \"diary style\" or \"minutes of meeting\" style record of the things that happen during the test drive. This could come in very handy.</li> <li>To sum it up shortly, be ready with a detailed \"test drive plan\" and have someone look at it before the test drive. Communicate with your driver about your objectives from the test drive and try to gather as much information as possible and try to make it easier for you do so (better organization, automation, tools).</li> </ol>"},{"location":"content-knowledgebase/writing_readme/","title":"Writing README","text":"<p>A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project.

If you don't understand some contents, ask your supervisor and help to improve the guide.</p> <p>If other students behave different from the workflow described in the userguide ask them why they do so. If they provide a reasonable explanation, discuss with your supervisor.</p> <p>Some students do not follow the userguide because they do not know it or they decided to ignore it. Do not worry about it.</p> <p>In order to become smarter, we do not recommend you to ignore the hints we are providing in the userguide.</p> <p>The userguide is the only source of truth during the onboarding process.</p> <p>Q: My work follows the target condition (TC) method. Since I work very hard, I do not have time to update the target condition. What should I do?</p> <p>A: Updating the target condition is part of your work and the target condition itself. You should take into account the additional time when estimating your due date. The past has shown that successful students need only 5..10 minutes to update their target condition.</p> <p>Q: What should I do when I realize that I will miss the due date of my target condition?</p> <p>A: When you realize that you will miss your due date, please do as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Describe in the issue why you will miss the due date before the due date has passed</li> <li>Why was your estimate wrong, what happened.<ul> <li>Pro tip: try to be honest to yourself: if you have bad time management, say it ... and improve it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What will you do to have a better estimate next time.</li> <li>Estimate a new due date and update the TC issue.</li> <li>Inform your supervisor that you will miss the due date and that you have updated the issue.</li> </ul> <p>Q: I do not know how to estimate the due date.

Broadly, PC3 helps an organization build consistently good software, cheaply, and rapidly. It has these specific goals: * To maximize the scale of the community around a project, by reducing the friction for new Contributors and creating a scaled participation model with strong positive feedbacks; * To relieve dependencies on key individuals by separating different skill sets so that there is a larger pool of competence in any required domain; * To allow the project to develop faster and more accurately, by increasing the diversity of the decision making process; * To support the natural life-cycle of project versions from experimental through to stable, by allowing safe experimentation, rapid failure, and isolation of stable code; * To reduce the internal complexity of project repositories, thus making it easier for Contributors to participate and reducing the scope for error. * To reduce the need for meetings, face-to-face presence, and timezone synchronization, by capturing knowledge more accurately. * To optimize the efficiency of worker resources, by using on-time self-assignment instead of up-front task allocation.</p>"},{"location":"content-ops/PC3/#preliminaries","title":"Preliminaries","text":"<ul> <li>The project SHALL use the git distributed revision control system.</li> <li>The project SHALL be hosted on GitLab or equivalent, herein called the \"Platform\".</li> <li>The project SHALL use the Platform issue tracker.</li> <li>The project SHOULD have clearly documented guidelines for code style.</li> <li>A \"Contributor\" is a person who wishes to provide a patch, being a set of commits that solve some clearly identified problem.</li> <li>A \"Maintainer\" is a person who merge patches to the project.

There are, in my experience, two types of contract:</p> <ul> <li>The APIs to client applications. The APIs need to be as absolutely simple, consistent, and familiar as possible.</li> <li>The protocols that connect the pieces.</li> </ul> <p>Writing contracts is perhaps the most difficult part of large-scale architecture.
