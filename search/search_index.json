First being that; sometimes it is easy to fall into a pattern (in this case <code>git add --&gt; git commit --&gt; expectation that everything is okay</code>) and to believe that there is nothing more to check and asking others to check things on their side. This is not right because there can always be subtle differences and it is always a good idea to double check on your own side before asking others. Second, it is important to recollect and retrace your steps while doing something second (or third usw) time because it is possible that you left out some small but critical step along the way. When we do something repeatedly, we slowly (and quite naturally) gain more and more confidence that we are doing things right and we are less and less skeptical of our performance. But this is kind of a fallacy. If mistake was made once, it can be easily made again (for the same reason it was made before) and it is a good idea to recollect \"what went wrong\" the first time one more time.</p>"},{"location":"content-knowledgebase/linux_hints_for_windows_users/","title":"Linux hints for Windows users","text":"<p>Our colleague Peter Kueffner shares a few notes about avoiding issues that Windows users have, when trying out Ubuntu (e.g. by setting up a Ubuntu VM):</p>"},{"location":"content-knowledgebase/linux_hints_for_windows_users/#sshsftp-access","title":"SSH/SFTP access","text":"<ul> <li>In order to be able to use PuTTY and FileZilla with Ubuntu, you need to install the <code>openssh-server</code> package via apt-get.

What do you aim to accomplish? What do others expect? Sure you have a good idea why, but have you confirmed with others interested in this test drive? Talk with them. Try to frame a simple single line \"purpose\" and confirm this with others. This is the most important thing to consider. It may affect the way you conduct the test drive, the locations you choose to go, various settings, configurations.</li> <li>Once you have enlisted the solid reason(s), motivation(s) for the test drive, think what data you would generate and in what format. Have a clear picture of what data you want to record and how you will do it. Do you need extra tools? Is your recording fully automatic or requires manual intervention? Do you have any concerns about your tools not working? Do you need to test them first before you start the actual test drive? Think about any likely but easily unforeseen situations. For example, if you are using some sort of map service and it is possible that you might not have Internet during the test drive, then you would probably want to cache the map before you start! Also, many times the data that you generate during your test drive is going to be volume intensive. So try to record data (for example your log files) in a way that it is easy to programatically read and parse it.</li> <li>Do you have any special requirements in the test drive? Should the car go through tunnels? Does the car need to be on a busy street or a highway? If there are such special requirements, make sure you talk about it with the person driving the car beforehand. Ideally, you should have a route prepared already.</li> <li>Might be beneficial to create small tables or text files in which you type in various kinds of details during the test drive. You should keep a \"diary style\" or \"minutes of meeting\" style record of the things that happen during the test drive. This could come in very handy.</li> <li>To sum it up shortly, be ready with a detailed \"test drive plan\" and have someone look at it before the test drive. Communicate with your driver about your objectives from the test drive and try to gather as much information as possible and try to make it easier for you do so (better organization, automation, tools).</li> </ol>"},{"location":"content-knowledgebase/writing_readme/","title":"Writing README","text":"<p>A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project.

Since I work very hard, I do not have time to update the target condition. What should I do?</p> <p>A: Updating the target condition is part of your work and the target condition itself. You should take into account the additional time when estimating your due date. The past has shown that successful students need only 5..10 minutes to update their target condition.</p> <p>Q: What should I do when I realize that I will miss the due date of my target condition?</p> <p>A: When you realize that you will miss your due date, please do as follows:</p> <ul> <li>describe in the issue why you will miss the due date before the due date has passed</li> <li>why was your estimate wrong, what happened<ul> <li>pro tip: try to be honest to yourself: if you have bad time management, say it ... and improve it ;)</li> </ul> </li> <li>what will you do to have a better estimate next time</li> <li>estimate a new due date and update the TC issue</li> <li>inform your supervisor that you will miss the due date and that you have updated the issue</li> </ul> <p>Q: I do not know how to estimate the due date. What should I do?</p> <p>A: Every student in our team should be able to estimate the amount of time he/she needs to reach a target condition (finish a task). If you have problems estimating the time, choose a smaller target condition. A one day duration is a good start.</p>"},{"location":"content-onboarding/working-with-GitHub/","title":"Working with GitHub","text":"<p>GitHub, Inc. is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control using Git, allowing developers to store and manage their code.
