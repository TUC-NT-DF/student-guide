# Working with Toyota KATA workflow

Toyota Kata is a systematic approach for developing continuous improvement habits that stick. The Toyota Kata framework turns scientific thinking into a practical skill anyone, and any organization, can learn through the deliberate practice of a four-step learning and discovery process. By following the Toyota Kata structure, we will elegantly move from our current state to our desired future state.

More information on KATA workflow can be found online.
