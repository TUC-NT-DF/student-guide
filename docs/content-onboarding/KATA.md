# Working with Toyota KATA workflow

Toyota Kata is a systematic approach for developing continuous improvement habits that stick. The Toyota Kata framework turns scientific thinking into a practical skill anyone, and any organization, can learn through the deliberate practice of a four-step learning and discovery process. By following the Toyota Kata structure, we will elegantly move from our current state to our desired future state.

More information on KATA workflow can be found online.

## Working with Marvin Bot

Marvin is a Python library that allows you to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) by writing code, rather than relying on prompts. Itâ€™s open source, free to use, and rigorously type-hinted. Developed by the engineering team at Prefect, Marvin is lightweight and designed for incremental adoption.
Here are some Key Points on Marvin:
1. Purpose: Marvin enables you to work with LLMs in a Pythonic way, without complex abstractions. It provides customizable decorators and utilities to enhance your existing code and make AI engineering tasks easier, regardless of the framework you use.
2. Configuration: You can set up Marvin and configure various aspects of its behavior.
3. AI Components: Marvin offers Pythonic interfaces to AI-powered functionality.
4. API Utilities: Low-level APIs allow you to build prompts and interact with LLMs.
